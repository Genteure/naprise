## Reporting issues

For bug reports, general feature requests, and other questions, please open an issue with the appropriate template.

Please note if I (`@Genteure`) am not actively using the service you are reporting an issue with, it may take longer for me to fix it.
It would be greatly appreciated if you could open a pull request with a fix!

## Requesting new services

Before requesting a new service, please check if it's already been requested by searching in the issues.
After you've checked, please open an issue with the [**Service Request**](https://github.com/Genteure/naprise/issues/new?template=service-request.yml) template.

## Implementing new services

Check out issues with the label `service-request` for a list of requested services.
Please send a comment on the issue if you have decided to work on it to avoid duplicate work.

If you want to implement multiple services, please open a pull request for each service.

See [Adding new service](https://genteure.github.io/naprise/new-service/) for more information.

## Style Guide

Use the settings in `.editorconfig` for formatting, format the code before committing.
The code style set in `.editorconfig` is only a guideline, not a strict rule.
If you think some code should be formatted differently, please open an issue.
